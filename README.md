Hi there! üëã <br>

I'm on a mission to change how the world sees software.

üå± I'm building the next generation of software applications.

üçÅ I'm developing the next version of AI trading bots that are consistent and profitable.

Over the past two years, I've built four software applications that help people achieve their goals faster:

1. **Akainu-V1**: Prototype SAAS app managing employee work rates and payments <br>

2. **Slot-Trader**: Financial crypto trading bot that monitors the crypto market and<br>
executes trades based on a predetermined set of criteria, such as<br>
identifying and taking advantage of long-term trends.<br>

3. **Ofalos**: Automated blog site powered by ChatGPT‚Äôs API.<br>

4. **Wariate**: AI-driven website that provides instant answers and solutions to<br>
student assignments and projects, powered by OpenAI's GPT<br>
technology.<br>
